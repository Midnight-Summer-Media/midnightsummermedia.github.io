                "Tomorrow would have been the best day. Tomorrow would have made happy memories. But after death knocked, he sets out to stop more - as he walks on a bitter path to vigilantism."

            <p class="writing">
                Brian Wolf receives a mysterious invitation to the United States from an old friend. But after what had happened to his family of years past, Brian hesitated to come. After the long, arduous flight away from old Ireland, he awaits the first sound and sight of all his friends in one place- the University of Pennsylvania. Something felt amiss, but it had been too late to keep death outside. Not long after, headlines break out about Brian's heroic act against death taking more lives. But everyone recognises him now – endangering everyone he knows, destroying him in all fronts – leaving no room for the life once lived.
