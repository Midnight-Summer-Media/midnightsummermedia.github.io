                This was the project that properly started my music journey.
            </p>
            <p class="writing">
                It was my academy’s Appreciation Week back in 2022, and in typical Miller fashion (I didn’t call myself that at the time), music was a major component in my presentation for appreciation. Then I thought to release the original music onto streaming platforms – this ended up being reality as my parents agreed to pay for single distribution.
            </p>
            <p class="writing">
                I find it funny that I’ve been making music since 2019 (five years now at the time of writing this), but I’ve only decided to release my work everywhere a full three years later. It wasn’t my best, but it was a start.
            </p>
            <p class="writing">
                Now, my name had been out there – but at the time, I called myself ‘Poppin Brown’. When I look back at it, I’m like… ‘why did I name myself this?’ ‘Why did I think about that?’ The old stage name eventually became the name of the experimental music project I had, to drop the ridiculous name.
            </p>
            <p class="writing">
                Next thing I did was plan out the entire journey ahead, so I decided to go through ‘stages’. Only two were made, though – Discovery, and Renaissance, respectively. This wasn’t sustainable, and in the end I decided to close out the project because of this, on top of lack of motivation and college obligations.
            </p>
            <p class="writing">
                The project is still up if you’d like to listen to it – it's on the top of the page. Though I warn you, it will be a mess. I've since shifted to making music under my current name.
