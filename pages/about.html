                Paulo Ponciano Tugonon (born 27 February 2005), also known as Paul Taylor Miller is a Filipino creative auteur specialising in music production, video editing and writing. His first foray into creativity is back in 2014 with an upright piano he had at home. He took an interest in it, and had a tutor come to his house to help acquaint him with the piano. To this day, his tutor continues teaching him after Tugonon learned how to compose five years after his initial piano lesson.

                Tugonon’s education timeline fluctuated between one school to another for basic education – though for college he stuck with the Adventist University of the Philippines. He is currently taking a bachelor's degree in Development Communication.

                The year 2019 saw his first look into music production – producing basic dance songs as well as some basic classical music, all in the former of which is deleted in favour of a ‘new generation’ of his creative ventures beginning in 2022, which included music with a near-complete orchestra (sans woodwinds), short film and podcast productions for academics, and experimental music involving ethereal and space-like sounds, among others. Tugonon personally enjoys this era, calling it ‘unbelievably exciting’. Since December 2024, some of his music now incorporates a level of microtones.

            <p class="writing">
                One of his favourite things to do is writing as it is the most effective way to vent out his feelings. His favourite genre to write in involves psychology and realism. He’s also into fantasy ever since his binge-watch session of the Harry Potter movies, but his implementation of such is mild.

                In November 2024, Tugonon started production of a podcast titled BetterU, which tackled common topics of student mental health. While the success was modest (as it was a major subject requirement at the time), he seeks to make more episodes in collaboration with AUP’s Department of Psychology and Guidance Services. His greatest achievement in the podcast is the fact that he made it all by himself due to the absence of his sole classmates in the course – allowing him to not only conceive the whole idea and conceptualise it, but also create all of his own bespoke music for the podcast.

                His production label Midnight Summer Media serves as the front for his audiovisual outputs, though the label was originally conceived sometime in 2014 under an entirely different name, which he forgot. The original iteration of Midnight Summer Media was formulated to comply with elementary requirements – it wasn’t until 11 January 2022 that he came up with the current name.
